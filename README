This is just a simple language file that can be loaded into Notepad++ to make
LC-3 assembly code easier to look at. I've given it the following rules:
 * Instructions are blue.
   * Underlined instructions set the condition code.
   * Italicized instructions use a program counter offset.
   * Underlined and italicized instructions do both.
 * TRAP instructions are light blue.
 * Pseudo-ops are brownish.
 * Registers are red.
 * Numbers are goldish.
 * Comments are green.

To use this language file:
 * Download the language file.
 * Open Notepad++.
 * "Language" menu.
 * "Define your language..." submenu.
 * "Import".
 * Browse for downloaded xml file.
 * Save
 * "Language" menu
 * Select your new language file at the bottom.
